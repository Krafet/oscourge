## Story :
The two marrows inadvertently stole a time travelling machine to a very powerful character. After that, they have to flee him, but accidentally messed up the time travelling machine, that teleports all of them at the Middle Ages.

## Gameplay :
In the first stage of each level, your goal is to run away to the right of the level fast enough in order not to be strike by the enemy. At this stage the screen is split in two, one for you, another for your partner. You will have to help the latter to pass some obstacles. After that, in the second stage, you will have to solve a puzzle that takes some gameplay elements already seen in the level. In this stage the screen is not split anymore.
