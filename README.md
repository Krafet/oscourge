## Story :
In his quest to find the perfect seasoning for his squash gratin, a mad scientist dropped a bit of life elixir on the squashes he was about to eat. Terrified by what he had just created, he threw them in his interdimensional trash. The poor squashes are now in the Middle Ages and have to run for their lives.

## Gameplay :
In the first stage of each level, your goal is to run away fast enough to avoid being hit by the enemy. At this stage the screen is split in two, one for you, another for your partner. You will have to help the latter to pass some obstacles, and vice versa. After that, in the second stage, you will have to solve a puzzle that takes some gameplay elements already seen in the level. In this stage the screen is not split anymore.
